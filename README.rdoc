= NFC

* http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

NFC is a ruby wrapper for the Near Field Communication library.  The Near
Field Communication library works with many USB RFID readers, so this gem
lets you read RFID tags.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only supports ISO1443A (MIFARE) tags right now.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'nfc'

  # Create a new context
  ctx = NFC::Context.new

  # Open the first available USB device
  dev = ctx.open nil

  # Block until a tag is available, then print tag info
  p dev.select

  # You can even run in an infinite loop if you'd like to continually find
  # tags:

  loop do
    p dev.select
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* A USB RFID reader.  I'm using the touchatag[http://touchatag.com].
* libnfc
